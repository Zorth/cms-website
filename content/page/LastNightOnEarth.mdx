  # Last Night on Earth: Eternal Night


  When the earth bursts open and colour drains from the sky, the end of the
  world is nigh. While some look for religion to save themselves, when creatures
  as pale as corpses leave underground caverns and catacombs, claiming what’s
  their birthmark upon the world, humans quickly perished except a select few.
  Civilisation falls with each passing second. The closest bastions increasing
  your chances of survival are closing their gates. Flee Kortrijk if you want to
  live. The full moon is bound to bring more trouble than we can defend
  ourselves against.
