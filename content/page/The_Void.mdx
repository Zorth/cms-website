Are you looking for a D\&D or Pathfinder Campaign? Do you want to join a large group of players from which you can pick your party and go on adventures with on a flexible schedule? This is it!

# What is *The Void*?

"The Void" is a both a Dungeons & Dragons and Pathfinder 2nd edition living world, persistent campaign, commonly referred to as a "West Marches" style campaign. What does all of this mean?

In short, it is a big campaign where you create a character and assemble a party per session. Gamemasters (GMs, or as we call them *Voidmasters*) will post timeslots and/or sessions they run which you can then sign up for, either alone or with your friends, using the character you've made beforehand.

## New to Dungeons & Dragons (or Tabletop Roleplaying Games)?

You can still definitely join, although it might be a bit harder to follow and get up and running. Just make sure to mention it to us so we can help you with everything you need to get started! We've got some experienced GMs ready to help you. ðŸ˜Ž

# How does it work?

So before hopping right in, there's a couple of things you should know about:

* Sessions are free for Kobolds (our members) but cost â‚¬ 2,00 for everyone else.
* Everything is communicated, planned, etc. on our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/TjDUu2Gkag). Give yourself the Void role and you'll have access to everything!
  * Certain parts of the D\&D part are managed on a google sheet, and optionally D\&DBeyond.
  * Most parts of the PF part are managed on [FoundryVTT.](http://vtt.tarragon.be/)
* Most, if not all, of our sessions are in person, in Kortrijk.
* You're gonna have to choose either or both systems to make character(s) in, in order to play in that system.
  * (That means characters aren't cross-system compatible, even though they are in the same world)
  * We can definitely help you if you've got any trouble making a character.
* We reimburse our Voidmasters with a bit of credit for hosting our games.
  * Want to become a GM for The Void? More info below.
  * Paying your Voidmaster with a compliment, a drink, or a donation, if you've enjoyed the session is always nice to see!

# I want to become a Voidmaster!

That's great to hear! You can run a (couple of) one-shot(s), a season or longer story, a full blown world/campaign, or anything else you can think of.

If you're already a player of ours, get in touch in the discord chat or through PMs, and make sure to read the rules and procedures in the discord thread.

If you're just hearing about this and it sounds like just the thing for you. Also welcome! But we've got a few things to tell you:

* In order to maintain the professionalism of the campaign, we encourage you to play a couple sessions with us or GM a session for us so we know you at least know the rules.
* When running for us, you'll get 500 gems (â‚¬ 5,00 credit) in Crafty Potions, per month you run a session in.
* You will be responsible for some minor bookkeeping about payment, sessions, etc. And to make sure your players are having a good time!
* You can (of course) still play in the other voidmaster's worlds
  * You will get XP/hours for the sessions you GM into a character of your choosing.
* It has to fit with the story and the world we're telling, which gives you a lot of freedom but not complete.
  * More details will be provided when signing up, don't hesitate to contact us!
