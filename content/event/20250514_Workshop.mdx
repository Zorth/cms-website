We're organizing another workshop night!

On Wednesday 14th of may 2025, starting at 19:00 - 22:00. We're hosting a Mini Painting Workshop and a Collaborative worldbuilding session. Entrance and participation is free! The session will be running throughout the evening so don't worry about arriving on time or leaving early, just be there when you can.

## Mini Painting Workshop

Hosted by some of our most proficient mini painters, they can guide you through the process of assembling, priming, painting, basing you mini and more! Bringing your own paints, brushes and minis? Then it's completely free!

Want to use our brushes and paints? That's free for Kobolds, and â‚¬ 2 for non-members.

## Collaborative Worldbuilding

Throughout the evening we'll be working together to create a world using prompts and input from everyone that feels like participating. And hopefully, by the end of the evening. You'll have an idea of how to create your own world or just use the one we created during the evening!
