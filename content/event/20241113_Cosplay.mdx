Time dust off those cosplay costumes! This evening is all about showing off your cosplay talents.

## Is there a sign-up?

No sign-up for this event

## Do I have to cosplay?

If you don't want to cosplay and just wonder at the creations of others that is also completely fine for us!

## What is expected of me?

Nothing, except for showing up in your favourite cosplay costume.

If you don't have time or the budget to create a cosplay from scratch here are some website with fun but low effort cosplays:
