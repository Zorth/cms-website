Join us at our Santa Drinks event!


We get together to enjoy a nice drink. While having a cosy chat/laugh with the fellows.


Sign up with the dragons to put your name in the hat. 

And receive a drink from a fellow fellow!


(When putting your name in the hat you'll also have to give a drink to a fellow fellow!)

Don't worry about being late there's enough drinks for everyone!
The Hat will do its magic at the following times.

* 19h15

* 20h00

* 20h45

* 21h30


(You can always sign out at the Dragons table to skip a round)


See you there!
