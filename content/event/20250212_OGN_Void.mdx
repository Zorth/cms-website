We are launching our living world campaign, [The Void](https://www.tarragon.be/The_Void)!

To kick it off with a bang, we're hosting 3 sessions/one-shots as well as organizing sign-ups/character creation for the campaign.

## Signing up

You can sign up for The Void campaign there, with someone present to provide you with all the details and questions you might have; As well as help you create your character for D\&D and/or Pathfinder, if you want to.

## Sessions

There will be 3 one-shots/sessions this evening, 1 Pathfinder & 2 DnD's. In order to sign up, you must send a message in the appropriate LFG post [on discord](https://discord.com/invite/TjDUu2Gkag).
