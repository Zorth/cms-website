✨ Step into the void and roll some dice!

Join us for Void Night, an evening of tabletop adventures hosted by the Dragons of Tarragon, perfect for new players or anyone curious to try D\&D or Pathfinder for the first time!

📅 When: Wednesday 22/10, 19:00–22:00

📍 Where: Het Textielhuis, Kortrijk (backroom)

We’ll have three tables running beginner-friendly sessions and a chill/signup table to hang out, get help, and more.

(Choose one of the premade character sheets or bring your own character in accordance with the Void rules, on discord).

Come for the dice, stay for the dragons. 🐲
