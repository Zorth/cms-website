Presented to you by DMs from both our community and Tarragon, we're happy to announce our first series of one-shots this year! 

#### What are one-shots?

A one-shot is a short DnD story that is played in a single night, rather than the many weeks, or even months, that a full DnD campaign would take. These are excellent for getting a taste for the game or trying out a new character.

#### Signing up

Signing up for a one-shot happens through [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/TjDUu2Gkag) and will be opened next week.

#### Hosting your own one-shot

If you're a DM interested in hosting a one-shot of your own, contact Brenainn (@rayningjesus) on Discord and if there are still spots available, he'll schedule you in.

## Planned one-shots:

### The Delian Tomb

A group of adventurers are asked to save the blacksmith's daughter from a nearby tomb defended by goblins.

* Game system: DnD 5e
* Max amount of players: 4 players
