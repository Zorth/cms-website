## Megagame: Alliance

### When?

This game will be played from 19:00 to 22:00 on Wednesday, the 2nd of April 2025.

### Where?

We gather in Crafty Potions. Found at Sint-Jansstraat 21, 8500 Kortrijk

### What?

Megagame: Alliance features a recognisable version of our world some time in the future. You are part of the council in charge of your nation. Growth is the main goal of this game and you as the advisors want to spread your influence through the natural resources your country has access to. Will you open the world to an era of peace or are more aggressive tactics necessary to come out on top?

Similar to other Roleplaying games, turns are taken where you communicate with your allies, but also with other nations. At the end a turn, you fill out an action report. You'll suggest an action taken by your nation based on the information gathered throughout the turn. These action reports are given to the game masters who'll discuss the likeliness of your actions taking place. Resources can be used to empower the success of these action. The game masters will try and create an interesting story with twists and turns while also giving thought to the various strategies and alliances forged throughout the game

Let's make this an event to remember.
