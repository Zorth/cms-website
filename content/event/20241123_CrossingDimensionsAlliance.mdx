### What?

Crossing Dimensions - Alliance will be the first official iteration of this event. It features a recognisable version of our world some time in the future where you are part of the council in charge of your nation. Growth is the main goal of this game and you as the advisors want to spread your influence through the natural resources your country has access to. Will you open the world to an era of peace or are more aggressive tactics necessary to come out on top?

Similar to other Roleplaying games, turns are taken where you communicate with your allies, but also with other nations. At the end a turn, you fill out an action report. You'll suggest an action taken by your nation based on the information gathered throughout the turn. These action reports are given to the game masters who'll discuss the likeliness of your actions taking place. Resources can be used to empower the success of these action. The game masters will try and create an interesting story with twists and turns while also giving thought to the various strategies and alliances forged throughout the game

Let's make this an event to remember.

## What is Crossing Dimensions?

Crossing Dimensions is another large scale anual event in which we bring the magic from board games, video games or film to our world. Imagine a world where you participate in the Hunger Games or the Squid Games yourself. Perhaps you find yourself in a lifesized board such as the ones you play during a game of mario party.

We take a deeper look into these popular franchises and do our best to imitate them as closely as we possibly can.
