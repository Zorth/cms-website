All kinds of cultures inhabit The Void. Many venture out into various worlds, exploring, slaying and most importantly saving the realm. Their job wouldn't be remotely possible without the aid of our experts that keep the infrastructure alive. One fact everyone can agree on: We all enjoy some mythical munchies.
