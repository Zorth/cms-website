The Void houses a variety of people. Some are adventures that go out to different worlds to help them with their problems, and enjoy the thrill of battle, while others stay back and help the world grow. One thing is the same for us, we all enjoy some mythical munchies.

I hope you brought an appetite. It’s time to enjoy flavours from across the multiverse. The chefs will prepare delicious foods for you to enjoy throughout the evening. Come over and sit back for a relaxing evening.
