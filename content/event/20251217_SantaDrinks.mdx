'Tis the season of giving. Why not share some generosity by exchanging a drink with a friend or a stranger? 

When you arrive, you can sign up with a dragon, and throughout the night, we’ll gather the names of anyone who wants to participate and let them be picked by someone else. You then buy a drink of your choosing for the name you’ve pulled, and they’ll do the same for you. We’re also hosting a variety of party games, like Jackbox, to entertain you throughout the night..
