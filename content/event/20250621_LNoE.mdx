Objective: 

* The goal of the game is for humans to survive against increasing numbers of creatures of the night while completing designated missions and challenges.

Role Assignment:

* Participants will be assigned the role of either a human or a creature of the night at the beginning of the event.

Gameplay:

* Humans will be armed with safe, foam designated weapons.
* Creatures of the night will attempt to tag humans to convert them. To accomplish this creatures of the night may run, surround, and otherwise strategize. They may NOT hide in order to ambush, lie about their role, or pretend to be human.
* Once tagged, humans must call out “HIT!” and raise their hand. They might become a creature of the night and must join the creature that tagged them. Put the bandana loosely on top of their head. Both the newly converted human and the one who tagged them must convene at the designated location where the kill will be confirmed. If the newly converted human loses their escort AND their bandana is removed from the head by another human, they’re saved from peril and can reenter the game as a human in The Bunker.
